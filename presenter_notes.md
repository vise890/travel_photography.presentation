# Travel Photography

Today I want to talk to you about travel *and* photography. And why they are an awesome combination.
I'll do so by telling you snippets about trips in India and other places and by showing you some of the pictures I took during my journeys.

"A travelling fool is better than a sitting wise man"
-- Nomadic Proverb

While this was outside a travel agency, and they were probably trying to guilt people into arranging trips with them, I think it holds a kernel of truth.
Travelling is indeed an enriching experience. And here's why I think so

## 1 - Rediscover where you come from
- I was drinking Chai at the appendices of the Himalayas.
- it was quite cold.
- .. and very beautiful
- That stunning view made me remember that I live by the Alps...thy're just an hour away
  - there are places worth visiting back home too
  - places I take for granted while I'm there

- WHY:
- while you're travelling, and especially when you're carrying a camera
  - you're more mindful of what's around you
  - that makes you more observant
  - more on the lookout for beauty
  
  - things that don't usually happen when commuting to work or going to the supermarket

## 2 - Find beauty in the world
- remember what a wonderful planet we live in
- sometimes is right there in your face
  - big, majestic things
- sometimes is a little more subtle
  - requires looking at things from a different angle
  - or to isolate it
  - .. and ..
  - .. remove the noise around it

  - in scrap metal
  - sometimes is just a view outside the window.

- sometimes it is in small things
  - requires keeping an eye out even more
  
- sometimes it happens when you least expect it

- sometimes you have to work more for it
  - me and my friend took this 40k bike ride to the south of Glasgow
  - as the night came, we decided to stay a bit more
  - .. and were rewarded with one of the most beautiful sunset I've seen in my life.

## 3 - re-assess your ways of life
- because you're confronted with very different ways of doing things..
- .. you're tend to re-consider the way *you* do them

- Engineers w/o borders.
  - NGO had to make bound copies of survey forms for gathering data in slums
  - they had printed a pile of copies for each page
    - one pile for page 1, one pile for page 2 and so on
    - there were ~10 people

  - I went in as an engineer, determined to make the place more efficient
    - we love efficiency
    - just buy a new photocopier!

  - slower pace of life in India
    - they stop and observe
    - they come together to eat
    - .. and generally they're happier for it
    
   - so I decided not to tell them about the photocopier
     - I realized that:
       - even though people took 1.5 days to make the copies, they:
         - talked to each other
         - got to know about each other
         - got to be just human beings with one another
         
       - something that perhaps is lost nowadays in modern office culture.
       
      
So I really think that travel can make you grow as a person. Certainly much of who I am has been shaped by being exposed to different cultures, people and places.
  
Thank you.
